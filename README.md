Solutions for problems on GeeksForGeeks.org

- Certain problems were listen under different sections in the website such as
  "recursion" or "hashmap". The solutions are all done using whatever data structure
  or algorithm they had in mind to solve the problem.

- For some solutions I have included before and after thoughts 

- Some solutions have comments in them that were written by the person setting up the problem.
  Their purpose is to offer clarity such as "the driver code is already written just implement the
  function" or "Your code goes here".
