DESCRIPTION
***

Working with 2D arrays is quite important. Here we will do swapping of column in a 2D array.
You are given a matrix M or r rows and c columns. You need to swap the first column with the last column.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains T, the number of testcases. T testcases follow.
Each testcase contains two lines of input. The first line contians r and c, separated by a space.
The next line contains r*c elements of the matrix, separated by spaces.

Output Format:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the modified matrix.

Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input.
Just complete the provided function interchange(int, int , int ) that take matrix, rows and columns as parameters.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= r,c <= 100

Example:
Input:
1
3 4
1 2 3 4
4 3 2 1
6 7 8 9
Output:
4 2 3 1
1 3 2 4
9 7 8 6

SOLUTION
***

/*Please note that it's Function problem i.e.
you need to write your solution in the form of Function(s) only.
Driver Code to call/invoke your function is mentioned above.*/

//User function Template for Java
/*Class Geeks with its member function interchange()
* a[][] = matrix input
* r : number of rows
* c : number of columns
*/
class Geeks{
    
    static void interchange(int a[][],int r, int c){
        
        // Your code here
        
        int subcol[] = new int[r];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < r; i++){
            subcol[i] = a[i][0];
            a[i][0] = a[i][c-1];
            a[i][c-1] = subcol[i];
        }
        
        for(int i = 0;i<r;i++){
            for(int j = 0;j<c;j++){
                System.out.print(a[i][j] + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        } 
    }
}
